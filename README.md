## About Me

I'm a student who enjoys the quieter side of things. I spend my time learning new concepts, writing code, and listening to music that matches whatever mood the day brings. 

I like keeping things simple and finding small ways to make projects feel personal. Coding is something I do for fun, not just work. There's something satisfying about building things piece by piece, even if they're just experiments.

## Skills

**Languages I work with:**

- Python
- SQL

I focus on learning fundamentals well rather than rushing through everything. Clean code and thoughtful problem-solving matter more to me than flashy tricks.

## What I'm Into

I'm drawn to calm, focused work. Music is always playing in the background while I code. I appreciate minimalist design and pixel art aesthetics. There's a cozy feeling in late-night coding sessions when everything else is quiet.

I believe in learning at your own pace and building things that feel meaningful, even if they're small.
